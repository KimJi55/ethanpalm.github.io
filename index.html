        <h1>Ethan Palm</h1>-Technical writer. Content designer. Author. I'm not set on a specific title. I love words and spend my time putting them together in ways that are useful or entertaining.

      <div> Right now, I'm a writer at <a href="https://www.github.com/">GitHub</a>.</div>
      <div>In the past, I've held a variety of writing roles where I produced content ranging from UX microcopy and HTML emails to magazine advertorials and press releases. I also did a year of <a href="https://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/americorps/americorps-programs/americorps-vista">AmeriCorps</a> service and moved back and forth across the United States a few times. I had a pleasant four years at <a href="https://anthropology.ucdavis.edu/">UC</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://writing.ucdavis.edu/academics/writing-minor">Davis</a> for undergrad and I got a graduate degree at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/academic-programs/ma-pw/index.html">CMU</a> during a pandemic.<span class="accent superscript" id="doubleasterisk">**</span></div>
