I'm Ethan Palm and I am a writer. People have a lot of titles for the kind of writing that I currently do and have done. Technical writer. Content designer. Corporate communications specialist. Author. Content strategiest. UX writer. Storyteller. Goofball.

If forced to pick a label, I prefer to call myself a content designer since it best captures my approach of figuring out why we need specific words before I sit down to write. At the end of the day, I just like how words sound.

If you want to get in touch, you can email me at ethanpalmATgmailDOTcom with some minor edits.
