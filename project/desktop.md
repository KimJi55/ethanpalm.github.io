# Background
I spent summer 2020 as an intern at [GitHub](https://www.github.com) on their product documentation team. I served as the lead writer on the content improvement plan for documentation for [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), a GUI software application for completing the Git workflow and connecting to GitHub.

My work consisted of two main phases.
- Define the audiences who are using the Desktop docs
- Write and edit the docs so that they meet users' needs

The GitHub Desktop documentation can be found at [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop).

# Audiences
I identified two main audiences who came to the Desktop docs.

- New users who do not know what they can do with Desktop or how to do it
- Power users who are trying to troubleshoot a specific issue

For new users, I wanted to make sure they could quickly get started and wouldn't abandon the app.

For power users, I wanted to make sure they had information to accomplish specific tasks and troubleshoot errors.

# The docs
For new users, I wrote quickstart guides that can take someone from not having GitHub Desktop on their computer to using the software as part of their Git workflow. An example of a quickstart guide that I wrote is "[Creating your first repository using GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/creating-your-first-repository-using-github-desktop)."

For power users, I wrote focused articles with conceptual and procedural knowledge to perform advanced tasks and troubleshoot error codes. Examples include "[About Git Large File Storage and GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/about-git-large-file-storage-and-github-desktop)" and "[Supported operating systems](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/supported-operating-systems)."

# Impact
Improving GitHub Desktop's documentation helps reduce attrition of new users, decrease support tickets opened, and provides a unified user experience across GitHub's other documentation.
