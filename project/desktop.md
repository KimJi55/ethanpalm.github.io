# Background
I spent summer 2020 as an intern at [GitHub](https://www.github.com) on the product documentation team. I served as the lead writer on the content improvement plan for documentation for [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), a GUI software application for completing the Git workflow and connecting to GitHub.

The GitHub documentation website averages over 3,000,000 unique visits per month. I needed to figure out what content would best serve the GitHub Desktop users, while remaining consistent with the other documentation on the website.

The GitHub Desktop documentation can be found at [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop).

# Problem
The existing GitHub Desktop documentation had been written as the app was developed by a mix of engineers, producet managers, and technical writers. Articles varied widely in their structure and tone. Gaps in documentation were identified based on attrition trends and how users were seeking knowledge outside of the docs. A sizable percentage of new GitHub Desktop users were abandoning the app after intsalling, but before connecting to GitHub. Other users were seeking help through support tickets and in community forums.

An opportunity existed to rewrite the existing documentation to be consistent with current GitHub content models and fill the gaps in content.

# Process
My work consisted of two main phases.

1) Define the audiences using the GitHub Desktop docs.

2) Write and edit the docs so that they meet users' needs

### Audiences
I identified two main audiences who came to the GitHub Desktop docs:

<b>New users</b> who do not know what they can do with Desktop or how to do it.

<b>Power users</b> who are trying to troubleshoot a specific issue.

For new users, I wanted to make sure they could quickly get started and wouldn't abandon the app.

For power users, I wanted to make sure they had information to accomplish specific tasks and troubleshoot errors.

### The docs
For new users, I wrote quickstart guides that can take someone from downloading and installing GitHub Desktop to using the software as part of their Git workflow. An example of a quickstart guide that I wrote is "[Creating your first repository using GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/creating-your-first-repository-using-github-desktop)."

For power users, I wrote focused articles with conceptual and procedural knowledge to perform advanced tasks and troubleshoot error codes. Examples include "[About Git Large File Storage and GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/about-git-large-file-storage-and-github-desktop)" and "[Supported operating systems](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/supported-operating-systems)."

### Impact
Improving GitHub Desktop's documentation helps reduce attrition of new users, decrease support tickets opened, and provides a unified user experience across GitHub's documentation.
