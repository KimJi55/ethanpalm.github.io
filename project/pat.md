# Background
I wrote prototype microcopy to guide users through the [PAT Track app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rectangledbmi.com.pittsburghrealtimetracker&hl=en_US), one of the most downloaded Pittsburgh transit apps for Android devices, for my Professional Writing course at Carnegie Mellon University.

I conducted an initial user test with the PAT Track app to find pain points and barriers for people who had never used the app before. I also went through app reviews to further investigate where users were getting stuck or abandoning PAT Track. With this knowledge, I prototyped quickstart cards that appear the first time someone uses the app, improved menu copy, and new menu headers. I conducted a follow up user test to see if my prototype improved people's ability to navigate the app.

The full prototype can be viewed on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/c8fv8JfIgbFHk5MamkGBDE/PAT-Tracker-redesign?node-id=25%3A63&scaling=scale-down).

I am not affiliated with PAT Track nor its development team.
