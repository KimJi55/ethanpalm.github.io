# Background
The [PAT Track](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rectangledbmi.com.pittsburghrealtimetracker&hl=en_US) app is one of the most downloaded Pittsburgh transit apps for Android devices. For my Professional Writing course at Carnegie Mellon University, I wrote prototype in-app microcopy to guide new users.

The full prototype can be viewed on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/c8fv8JfIgbFHk5MamkGBDE/PAT-Track-prototype?node-id=25%3A16&scaling=scale-down).

I am not affiliated with PAT Track nor its development team.

# Problem
Currently, PAT Track does not instruct users how to select bus routes in the app. The app has two different menu paths that will leaed to the bus route selection screen, so there are multiple ways for users to access the main feature of the app. Still, new users can struggle to select and clear bus routes.

My proposed solution was to introduce getting started cards that appear the first time a user opens the app, menu labels that instruct how to select bus routes, and an in-app FAQ menu that includes information based on questions from user interviews and social media comments about the app.

# Process
I conducted an initial user test with the PAT Track app to find pain points and barriers for people who had never used the app before. I also analyzed reviews in the Google Play Store and comments on Twitter to further investigate where users were getting stuck or abandoning PAT Track. With this knowledge, I prototyped quickstart cards, improved menu copy, new menu headers, and an in-app FAQ screen. I conducted a follow up user test to see if my prototype improved people's ability to navigate the app.
