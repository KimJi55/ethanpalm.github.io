Despite spending my days writing professionally and studying writing, I also enjoy writing for fun. I mainly write short ficiton and theatre with the occassional creative nonfiction piece.

One of my stories was selected for a [Community College Humanities Association award](https://www.cchumanities.org/about-ccha/awards-and-opportunities/awards-2/literary-magazine-competition/literary-magazine-contest-winners-individual-2018/). You can read it <a href="/Ghost-Fishing.pdf">right here</a>.
